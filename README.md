# FancyPack (working name)
Break free from NPM for managing your styles; use FancyPack instead. Manage all your CSS, Sass, SCSS, and Stylus files with a _style_ package manager. 


Built with Node, Express, and ArangoDB. 


## Pre-requisites
* Docker
* Node 16+

## Getting Started
`docker compose up` for building out the arangoDB container

Haven't gotten the node container working yet. So comment that out. 

```bash

cd api
npm install
npm run start
```
